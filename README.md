# techTestProject

###Task 1 : Website Service Test Suite
I used Maven type project for this task, I used Rest assured and TestNG framework.
In steps class, I created request template, which only sends request with specific headers.
Validate response is in the test class, with specific login parameters.
At this kind of response validation, at same time we can validate status code, response headers, response body, etc.


I also added allure results, which shows report of the test, with full information and prettier.


###Task 2: Transaction Flow Test Suite
For Task2 I used Cucumber and Rest assured collaboration, 
I created features file, where I wrote four test scenario with their Given/When/Then/And syntax.
